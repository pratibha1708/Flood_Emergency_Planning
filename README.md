# Flood_Emergency_Planning

Software step by step implements the following: <br>
• Accepts information about the user's location as input. <br>
• Finds the highest point in a given radius (that is, the point to which it is most reliable to
evacuate). <br>
• Finds the nodes of the road graph that are located closest to the user's location and to the
highest point. <br>
• Finds the shortest evacuation route between mentioned above nodes according to the
Naismith’s rule. <br>
• Displays the route on the map for user orientation. <br>
